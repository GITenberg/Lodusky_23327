description: Born in England, Frances Hodgson Burnett emigrated to Knoxville, Tennessee
  with her family at the age of 16. Faced with financial hardship, she began to write
  fiction and non-fiction pieces as a means of making money. Eventually, she emerged
  as a popular writer of children's literature, penning such classics as The Secret
  Garden, A Little Princess, and Little Lord Fauntleroy. "Lodusky," a short story
  set in the American South, will please fans of Burnett's work.
